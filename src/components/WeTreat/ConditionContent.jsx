        "Neck pain often results from poor posture, particularly during prolonged activities such as sitting at a desk or using a smartphone. Muscle strain from overuse or sudden movements, such as whiplash, can also cause neck pain. Degenerative changes in the cervical spine, like osteoarthritis or herniated discs, contribute to chronic neck discomfort. Physiotherapists also identify stress and tension as significant factors, leading to muscle tightness and pain.",

Poor posture, especially when sitting or lifting incorrectly, is a common contributor. Chronic conditions such as scoliosis, spinal stenosis, or degenerative disc disease exacerbate back pain. A sedentary lifestyle, weak core muscles, and poor ergonomics can also lead to or worsen back pain, which physiotherapists address through targeted exercises and posture correction.",

Degenerative conditions like osteoarthritis lead to joint pain and stiffness. Ligament injuries, such as ACL tears, or meniscal damage from trauma or sports injuries, are significant causes.

Structural abnormalities like flat feet or high arches contribute to pain and discomfort. Stress fractures from repetitive impact, such as running, are common. Physiotherapists also consider conditions like tendinitis, nerve entrapment (e.g., tarsal tunnel syndrome), and arthritis when diagnosing and treating foot pain.",

Impingement syndrome, where tendons are pinched during arm movements, is another common cause. Conditions like frozen shoulder (adhesive capsulitis) and arthritis can lead to stiffness and pain.

Bursitis, tendinitis, and labral tears are other common causes, frequently related to overuse or trauma. Hip impingement, where the bones of the hip joint rub abnormally, leads to pain and restricted movement.
