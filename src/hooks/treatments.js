    description: `
      Back pain is a common issue addressed at MY PAIN CLINIC, a leading pain management clinic in Mumbai. Back pain can range from a mild, dull ache to severe, debilitating pain that affects your daily activities. It refers to discomfort or pain felt anywhere along your spine or in the muscles, nerves, or other soft tissues surrounding the spine. The causes of back pain vary and include muscle or ligament strain, poor posture, injury, degenerative conditions like osteoarthritis and spinal stenosis, herniated discs, and underlying medical conditions. Back pain can be acute, lasting for a few days to a few weeks, or chronic, lasting for more than three months. It can range from a dull, constant ache to a sudden, sharp pain that makes it difficult to move, and it can also radiate to other areas of the body, such as the hips, legs, or shoulders.

  title: 'Slipped Disc',
  description: `
    A slipped disc, also known as a herniated disc or a ruptured disc, occurs when one of
    the discs that cushion the vertebrae in your spine bulges or ruptures, causing the inner
    gel-like material to protrude. This can result in pressure on nearby nerves, leading to
    pain, numbness, or weakness in the affected area.
    The spine is made up of a series of bones called vertebrae, which are separated by
    discs that act as shock absorbers and allow for flexibility. Each disc has a tough outer
    layer called the annulus fibrosus and a soft, jelly-like center called the nucleus pulposus.
    When a disc herniates, the inner material (nucleus pulposus) pushes through a tear or
    weakness in the outer layer (annulus fibrosus) and can press on nearby spinal nerves
    or the spinal cord itself.

      Neck pain is a common issue that can result from a variety of causes, including muscle strain, poor posture, injury, or underlying medical conditions. The neck, or cervical spine, is composed of vertebrae that extend from the skull to the upper torso. Cervical discs absorb shock between the bones. The bones, ligaments, and muscles of your neck support your head and allow for motion. Any abnormalities, inflammation, or injury can cause neck pain or stiffness. In many cases, neck pain isn't a serious condition and can be relieved within a few days. But in other cases, neck pain can indicate a more severe issue that requires medical attention. Symptoms of neck pain can range from mild discomfort to severe pain that radiates to the shoulders, arms, or head, and can also include headaches, numbness, or weakness.

    ACL (Anterior Cruciate Ligament) and MCL (Medial Collateral Ligament) tears are common injuries treated at MY PAIN CLINIC, a leading pain management clinic in Mumbai. These ligament injuries often occur during activities that involve sudden stops, jumps, or changes in direction, such as sports. An ACL tear affects the ligament that connects the thigh bone to the shin bone at the knee, while an MCL tear affects the ligament on the inside of the knee that provides stability

The goal is to ensure a safe and efficient recovery, minimize complications, and prevent future injuries. Rehabilitation may include physical therapy, exercise, pain management, and education about proper movement and care of the surgical area. Depending on the type of surgery, the rehabilitation program can vary significantly. For instance, post-operative rehab for joint replacement surgery will focus on restoring joint mobility and strength, while rehab for spinal surgery may prioritize spinal stability and reducing pain. The benefits of post-surgical rehabilitation include faster recovery, improved mobility, reduced pain and swelling, and better overall outcomes. Patients in a structured rehab program are more likely to return to their daily activities and maintain a higher quality of life.
