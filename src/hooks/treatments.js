      Back pain refers to discomfort or pain that you feel anywhere along your spine or in the
      muscles, nerves, or other soft tissues surrounding the spine. It's a very common
      condition that can vary widely in intensity and duration. Back pain can be acute, lasting
      for a few days to a few weeks, or chronic, lasting for more than three months. It can
      range from a dull, constant ache to a sudden, sharp pain that makes it difficult to move.
      The pain can also radiate to other areas of the body, such as the hips, legs, or
      shoulders.

  description: `
    A slipped disc, also known as a herniated disc or a ruptured disc, occurs when one of
    the discs that cushion the vertebrae in your spine bulges or ruptures, causing the inner
    gel-like material to protrude. This can result in pressure on nearby nerves, leading to
    pain, numbness, or weakness in the affected area.
    The spine is made up of a series of bones called vertebrae, which are separated by
    discs that act as shock absorbers and allow for flexibility. Each disc has a tough outer
    layer called the annulus fibrosus and a soft, jelly-like center called the nucleus pulposus.
    When a disc herniates, the inner material (nucleus pulposus) pushes through a tear or
    weakness in the outer layer (annulus fibrosus) and can press on nearby spinal nerves
    or the spinal cord itself.
